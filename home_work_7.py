#Make a program that has some sentence (a string) on input and returns a dict containing all unique words as keys and the number of occurrences as values.
#dict1={}
# s = input(str("How are you today?\n"))
# s1 = s.split()
# s2 = {s1[i]: s1[i+1] for i in range(0, len(s1),2)}
# print(s2)
# print(type(s2))
 
 
#2Create a function which takes as input two dicts with structure mentioned above, then computes and returns the total price of stock. stock = {
# stock = {'banana': 6, 'apple': 0, 'orange': 32, 'pear': 15}
# prices = {'banana': 4, 'apple': 2, 'orange': 1.5, 'pear': 3}
# stocks = {v: stock[v]*prices[v] for v in prices}
# total = sum(stocks.values())
# print("The stocks are:\n", stocks)
# print("The total amount of goods are:", (total))

#Use a list comprehension to make a list containing tuples (i, j) where `i` goes from 1 to 10 and `j` is corresponding to `i` squared.

# i = tuple([x for x in range(11)])
# j = tuple([x**2 for x in range(11)])
# tuple1 = i+j
# print(tuple1)
